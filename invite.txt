Dear All,

Good news, everyone! "Learning to Program" has enough interest to go ahead. I'm
really delighted, I hope this will be a lot of fun. This email covers logistics
and preparation. Any questions, drop me a line.


Future announcements
====================

Most importantly: from now on, all announcements will be on the #code-club
channel on Slack. Sign up here:

FIRST GET-TOGETHER
==================

Friday, May 5th, 12-1pm. (In ... Augusta? Room 1.2, anyway).


Logistics 
=========

There will be two hours a week, both in Room 1.2 (Augusta?):

  - "Code Club": Friday lunchtimes, noon-1pm (first one is May 5th).

  - A formal class: Tuesday mornings, 11am (first one is May 9th)

The formal class is for me to introduce and explain new topics.

Code Club is for practicing (which is really important!). I'll suggest some
things to have a go at (probably from the book) and be around to help with
questions on anything. (I will also bring my lunch.)

The first get-together will actually be a Code Club. Have a go at installing
Racket before then (see below) but if you run into trouble we can try to fix it
on that Friday.


Preparation
===========

1. Please download and install Racket from http://racket-lang.org (the download
   button is in the top right).

2. Make sure you can run DrRacket. It should look something like the picture
   here: http://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/interface-essentials.html

3. Make sure you have found the online book. It's here:
   http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/index.html

   Feel free (but not obliged!) to read the Preface.


That's all! See you Friday 5th.


James
