# Code Club 3

We are continuing our stroll through the Prologue of HtDP2e. 

(When we have finished this stroll, you will know much of the language. Then we
will start over and talk about a more systematic way of designing programs.)


## Recap of 02

_Expressions_ are little questions for Racket to answer. We saw two ways to make
expressions. An expression is either:

  1. A _value_; or
  
  2. `(` _function_ _expression<sub>1</sub>_ expression<sub>2</sub>_  ... `)`

The value of the first kind of expression is itself. To evaluate the second kind
of epression, Racket first evaluates all the sub-expressions, then applies the
function to the values produced. 

We also now know several kinds of value. A _value_ is either: 

  1. A number (`42`);
  2. A string (`"Hello, World."`);
  3. A "Boolean" (either `#true` or `#false`); or
  4. An image


## Ã‰tudes

(1) Convert 5 feet to inches. (There are 12 inches in a foot.)

(2) Convert 5 feet 7 inches to inches.

(3) Convert 5 feet 7 inches to centimetres. (There are 2.54 centimetres in an
    inch.)

(6) How many letters are there in "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" ? (Hint:
    remember there is a function called "`string-length`")
    
(7) Look in the documentation for `string-ith`. What is the 10th letter of
    "antidisestablishmentarianism"?
    
    The documentation is under "*How to Design Programs* Languages", under "1
    Beginning Student".

(8) Look in the documentation for `string<?`. What is `(string<? "hello" "goodbye")`?

(9) What is `(and (or #true #false #false) (or #false #false))`? (Try to guess
    before entering it into Racket.) 

(10) In the current language we are using, Beginning Student, the function `+`
     (as in, for example, `(+ 2 3)`) must take at least two arguments. In the
     "full" language it can take any number of arguments, including one or none.
    
     If you wanted to give a meaning to `+` on one argument, what would it be?
     That is, what do you think `(+ 2)` *should* be?
    
     What do you think the sum of no numbers should be? (That is, what would you
     want from `(+)`?)
        
     (Note that both of those will give an error in our current language.)
    
    










## Other exercises 

(4) The earth is 24000 miles around the equator. How many meters is that? (There
    are 1.6 kilometres in a mile).

(5) The speed of light is 3&times;10<sup>8</sup> metres per second. How long
    does it take light to go around the earth?
